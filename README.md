Project Title: Sprint 6 Project/ Data Collection And Storage (SQL) 

Project Description: This project consists of exploratory data analyses and hypothesis testing of information from Zuber, a new ride sharing company in Chicago (hypothetical company). 
The main objective of this project is to understand passenger preferences and the impact of external factor on rides.  The parsing technique is used in order to read/upload the dataframe from a URL using the: requests and bs4 libraries This project includes various Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) sections as well as a hypothesis testing task at the end of the project. 

Tasks Presented In The Project: 

1) Import the files.
 
2) Study the data they contain.
   
3) Make sure the data types are correct.
   
5) Identify the top 10 neighborhoods in terms of drop-offs.
 
6) Make graphs: taxi companies and number of rides, top 10 neighborhoods by number of dropoffs.

7) Draw conclusions based on each graph and explain the results.

8) Test the hypothesis:

"The average duration of rides from the Loop to O'Hare International Airport changes on rainy Saturdays."

Decide where to set the significance level (alpha) on your own.

Explain:

* How you formed the null and alternative hypotheses.

* What criterion you used to test the hypotheses and why.
